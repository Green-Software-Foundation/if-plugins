- **What**: 
- **Why**: 
- **DoD**:
- [ ] Does the model meet the specification?
- [ ] Does the model have complete test coverage, including edge cases, happy path and error cases?
- [ ] Is the code documented?

## Config
- `variable`: If this variable is present in the top level config what behaviour does it trigger? What is the default value if none is provided?

## Inputs
_List the variables this model expects in an input input_
- `variable`: Description

## Outputs
_List the variables this model exports out as an impact_
- `variable`: Description

## Behavior
What does the model do to turn the inputs into outputs? List any important equations or references.

## Assumptions
What are the core assumptions this model makes?

## Limitations
In what situations is this model limited in it's function, behaviour, accuracy etc...

## Example
Provide at least one example of some input config and inputs. This is in pimpl format not rimpl format, so the config is the global config and all parameters must be present on the input.

### Input

```yaml
config:
 key: value
inputs: 
  - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
    duration: 3600
```

### Output

```yaml
config:
 key: value
inputs: 
  - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
    duration: 3600
    yyyy: zzzz
outputs: 
  - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
    duration: 3600
    yyyy: zzzz
    aaaa: bbbb
```
