# SCI-E (total energy)

`sci-e` is a plugin that simply sums up the contributions to a component's
energy use. The plugin returns `energy` which is used as the input to
the `sci-o` plugin that calculates operational emissions for the component.

## Parameters

### Plugin config

Not Needed

### Inputs

At least one of:

- `cpu/energy`: energy used by the CPU, in kWh
- `memory/energy`: energy used by memory, in kWh
- `network/energy`: energy used to handle network traffic, in kWh

plus the following required:

- `timestamp`: a timestamp for the input
- `duration`: the amount of time, in seconds, that the input covers.

## Returns

- `energy`: the sum of all energy components, in kWh

## Calculation

`energy` is calculated as the sum of the energy due to CPU usage, energy due
to network traffic, energy due to memory and energy due to GPU usage.

```pseudocode
energy = 'cpu/energy' + 'network/energy' + 'memory/energy'
```

In any plugin pipeline that includes `sci-o`, `sci-o` must be preceded by `sci-e`.
This is because `sci-o` does not recognize the individual contributions,
`cpu/energy`, `network/energy`, etc, but expects to find `energy`.
Only `sci-e` takes individual contributions and returns `energy`.

## Implementation

To run the plugin, you must first create an instance of `SciE`. Then, you can call `execute()` to return `energy`.

```typescript
import {SciE} from '@grnsft/if-plugins';

const sciE = SciE();
const result = await sciE.execute([
  {
    'cpu/energy': 0.001,
    'memory/energy': 0.0005,
    'network/energy': 0.0005,
  },
]);
```

## Example manifest

IF users will typically call the plugin as part of a pipeline defined in a `manifest` file. In this case, instantiating the plugin is handled by `if` and does not have to be done explicitly by the user. The following is an example `manifest` that calls `sci-e`:

```yaml
name: sci-e-demo
description:
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    sci-e:
      method: SciE
      path: '@grnsft/if-plugins'
tree:
  children:
    child:
      pipeline:
        - sci-e
      config:
        sci-e:
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-08-06T00:00
          duration: 3600
          cpu/energy: 0.001
```

You can run this example `manifest` by saving it as `./examples/manifests/test/sci-e.yml` and executing the following command from the project root:

```sh
npm i -g @grnsft/if
npm i -g @grnsft/if-plugins
ie --manifest ./examples/manifests/test/sci-e.yml --output ./examples/outputs/sci-e.yml
```

The results will be saved to a new `yaml` file in `./examples/outputs`.
